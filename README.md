# bu-g-fre2e-kt8po4int-dis3cuss65ions-tribble
Discussion board for ktpoint.cn. The strange repo name is to prevent being searched.

# Why this repo name?

When I created the repo, Github suggested the name "bug-free-tribble", so I mixed that with "discussions" and added random numbers and hyphens to avoid being searched.
